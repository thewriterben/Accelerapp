# Security Best Practices

## Overview

The ESP32 Marauder and Flipper Zero integration provides powerful security testing capabilities. This document outlines best practices and ethical guidelines for their use.

## Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### Authorization Requirements

**Always obtain explicit written permission** before performing any security testing:

1. **Network Testing**
   - Written authorization from network owner
   - Scope of testing clearly defined
   - Time windows agreed upon
   - Emergency contact information

2. **Physical Access Testing**
   - Property owner consent
   - Building management approval
   - Security team notification
   - Incident response plan

3. **IoT Device Testing**
   - Device owner authorization
   - Clear testing boundaries
   - Data handling agreement
   - Vulnerability disclosure timeline

### Legal Compliance

- **Know Your Local Laws**: Unauthorized access is illegal in most jurisdictions
- **Federal/State Regulations**: Comply with computer fraud and abuse acts
- **Industry Standards**: Follow PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX where applicable
- **International Laws**: Respect cross-border regulations

## Configuration Security

### Enable Audit Logging

```yaml
# config/hardware_devices.yaml
security:
  global_policies:
    enable_audit_log: true
    audit_log_file: "logs/hardware_audit.log"
```

### Require Authorization

```yaml
security:
  global_policies:
    require_authorization: true
    authorization_timeout: 300  # seconds
```

### Rate Limiting

```yaml
security:
  global_policies:
    enable_rate_limiting: true
    max_operations_per_minute: 60
```

## Operational Security

### Secure Storage

1. **Configuration Files**
   - Store configs in secure directories
   - Use appropriate file permissions (600/700)
   - Encrypt sensitive parameters
   - Version control exclusions

2. **Captured Data**
   - Encrypt packet captures
   - Secure storage locations
   - Retention policies
   - Secure deletion when complete

3. **Credentials**
   - Never hardcode credentials
   - Use environment variables
   - Implement key rotation
   - Secure credential storage

### Network Isolation

1. **Testing Environment**
   - Use isolated test networks
   - Separate from production
   - Air-gapped when possible
   - Controlled access

2. **Device Isolation**
   - Dedicated testing hardware
   - Separate from personal devices
   - Controlled connectivity
   - Clean environments

## Attack Prevention

### Deauthentication Attacks

```python
# Only on authorized networks
marauder = ESP32Marauder()

# Validate authorization
if authorized_network(target_network):
    marauder.start_attack(
        attack_type=AttackType.DEAUTH,
        targets=[target_mac],
    )
```

### Packet Capture

```python
# Implement privacy controls
manager.add_callback("packet_captured", sanitize_pii)

# Limit capture scope
results = await manager.unified_scan(
    capabilities={DeviceCapability.PACKET_CAPTURE},
    duration=60.0,  # Limited time
)
```

## Data Protection

### PII Handling

1. **Sanitization**
   - Remove MAC addresses
   - Strip device names
   - Anonymize location data
   - Redact credentials

2. **Storage**
   - Encrypted at rest
   - Access controls
   - Audit trails
   - Retention limits

3. **Transmission**
   - TLS/SSL encryption
   - Secure channels
   - Authentication required
   - Integrity checks

### Responsible Disclosure

1. **Vulnerability Discovery**
   - Document findings
   - Assess severity
   - Prepare remediation guidance
   - Timeline for disclosure

2. **Notification Process**
   - Contact vendor security team
   - Provide technical details
   - Allow reasonable fix time
   - Coordinate public disclosure

## Incident Response

### Detection

Monitor for:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Unusual scan patterns
- Rate limit violations
- Failed authentications

### Response

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop operations
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Document incident

2. **Investigation**
   - Review audit logs
   - Analyze captured data
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess impact

3. **Remediation**
   - Fix vulnerabilities
   - Update configurations
   - Enhance monitoring
   - Training updates
