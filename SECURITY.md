## Security Best Practices

When using Accelerapp:

### For Code Generation
- Review generated code before deployment to production
- Run security analysis on generated code using the SecurityAnalysisAgent
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use secure coding practices in your configurations

### For API Usage
- Store API keys securely (use environment variables, not hardcode)
- Implement proper rate limiting for your deployments
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Rotate API keys regularly

### For Air-Gapped Deployments
- Enable encryption for all data storage
- Configure access control with least privilege principle
- Enable audit logging for compliance tracking
- Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity
- Keep security patches up to date

### For Generated Firmware
- Validate hardware configurations before flashing
- Use secure boot when available on target platforms
- Implement secure communication protocols
- Follow platform-specific security guidelines
