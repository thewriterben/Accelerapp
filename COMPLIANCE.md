## Using Accelerapp in Regulated Environments

### Current Recommendations

For projects in regulated industries (automotive, aviation, medical, etc.):

1. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct thorough risk assessment for your specific application
2. **Code Review**: Manually review all generated code before deployment
3. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing beyond Accelerapp's generation
4. **Documentation**: Maintain complete documentation of your usage and modifications
5. **Validation**: Perform independent validation and verification
6. **Tool Qualification**: Consider Accelerapp as a development tool requiring qualification

### Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **Accelerapp 1.0.0 is NOT certified for use in safety-critical systems** ⚠️

- Do not use generated code in safety-critical applications without proper validation
- Formal certification and qualification required for regulated industries
- Generated code should be reviewed and validated by qualified engineers
- Accelerapp is a development tool, not a certified code generator
- Users are responsible for compliance with industry-specific regulations
